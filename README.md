# BST
This is a recursive-based implementation of the Binary Search Tree data structure. It is used to store string inputs from a text file in alphabetical order.

For the purpose of this data structure, we will start by read string inputs from a text file and store them in a BST. The BST includes the following operations:

. Copy the contents of the entire tree.

. Insert a string to the tree in alphabetical order.

. Retrieve all instances of a key input.

. Display all instances of a key input.

. Display all string contents within the tree.

. Remove all instances of a key input.

. Remove all string contents from the tree.

(A makefile is used to run the program.)

# The sprints of this project to its completion is as follow:

# V1*: 
Implement a basic structure of the data structure and ensure the support of all previous functions.
# V2*:
Overload operators wherever possible and commit all the changes.
# V3*:
Use const references wherever possible and commit all the changes.
# V4*: 
Switch the entire data structure and its functionality into a template form and commit all the changes.
